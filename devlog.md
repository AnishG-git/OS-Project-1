- Began looking at the project
- Ran cpu.py and understood the existing provided code
- Created a makefile to simplify running the project

### Initial thoughts (forgot to add last time)

- I know that I need to create three separate programs (a logger, an encryption program, and a driver program)
- I plan to create three separate files (one for each program)

## [03/20/2025] 10:53 AM (session 1 start)

- My plan is to create the logger first. I want to do this part first because I have some experience writing to files in python so it's more of a low hanging fruit. I'll also start with the drivery but really only the bare minimum for the logger to work.

## [03/21/2025] 7:55 PM (session 1 end)

- I forgot to commit my changes from session 1 so that's why I'm committing the next day
- I was able to successfully create the logger and the MVP of the driver with regard to the logger
- A problem I ran into was that the output of the logger was not showing up in the logfile. However, I realized that the solution was that I needed to manually flush to the logfile

## [3/21/2025] 8:10 PM (session 2 start)

- For this session, I plan on finishing up the project by creating the encryption process and modifying the driver program to acknowledge all specified commands with proper functionality.
