### Initial thoughts (forgot to add last time)

- I know that I need to create three separate programs (a logger, an encryption program, and a driver program)
- I plan to create three separate files (one for each program)

- My plan is to create the logger first. I want to do this part first because I have some experience writing to files in python so it's more of a low hanging fruit. I'll also start with the drivery but really only the bare minimum for the logger to work.
