# Project: Encryption and Logging System

This project consists of three programs that work together to provide a basic encryption and decryption system using the Vigenère cipher, along with logging functionality.

## Directory Structure
```
os-project-1/
├── devlog.md      # Development log with progress notes
├── driver.py      # Main driver program to handle user interaction
├── encryption.py  # Encryption and decryption using Vigenère cipher
├── logfile.txt    # Output file for logging messages
├── logger.py      # Logger program to write messages to logfile.txt
└── makefile       # Simplified makefile for running the project
```

## Program Descriptions

### 1. `driver.py`
- Acts as the main interface for the user.
- Launches both the `logger.py` and `encryption.py` processes using `subprocess`.
- Manages user input to perform encryption, decryption, and password management.
- Supports maintaining an encryption/decryption history.

### 2. `encryption.py`
- Implements the Vigenère cipher for encryption and decryption.
- Accepts commands through standard input.
- Responds with results or error messages to standard output.

### 3. `logger.py`
- Logs messages to the `logfile.txt` with timestamps.
- Listens for input from the driver process and writes to the log file.

### 4. `devlog.md`
- A development log documenting the progress of the project.

### 5. `logfile.txt`
- Stores log messages generated by `logger.py`.

### 6. `makefile`
- Provides a convenient way to run the program.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you are in the `anishg-git-os-project-1` directory.
2. Run the following command using the makefile:
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
    This is equivalent to:
    ```bash
    python driver.py logfile.txt
    ```
3. Follow the prompts to interact with the program.

## Available Commands
- `password`: Set or update the encryption key.
- `encrypt`: Encrypt a string using the set password.
- `decrypt`: Decrypt a string using the set password.
- `history`: View the history of encrypted and decrypted strings.
- `quit`: Exit the program.

## Sample run
```
make run

Enter command (password, encrypt, decrypt, history, quit): password 
Enter passkey: secret
RESULT

Enter command (password, encrypt, decrypt, history, quit): encrypt 
Enter alphabetical string to encrypt: hello
RESULT ZINCS

Enter command (password, encrypt, decrypt, history, quit): decrypt
[0] Choose string from history
[1] Enter new string
Enter choice: 0

[0] HELLO
[1] ZINCS
Enter choice: 1
RESULT HELLO

Enter command (password, encrypt, decrypt, history, quit): history
History: ['HELLO', 'ZINCS']

Enter command (password, encrypt, decrypt, history, quit): quit
```

## Notes
- Ensure that the log file (`logfile.txt`) is accessible and writable.
- The program maintains a simple in-memory history of strings encrypted or decrypted.
- Encryption and decryption only work with alphabetic strings (A-Z).
- I used Python 3.11.5
